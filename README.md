# Spinning Rotation Force
In this project we can see the magnetic field rotation effects. A field element is an algorithm that applies a force on a given point in space. We are going to use this force to change the position of certain points to obtain the result.

Using the certain parameters we can see its different variations or behaviors resulting in smooth magnetic effect .The parameters are as follows:

# Parameters

Gap:Using this parameter we can control the distance between the circles .

Center : Using this parameters we can increase or decrease the number of circles .minimum and maximum value lies between 1-5.

Boundary : itâ€™s shows the footprint or boundary base of the geometry.

Radius : using this slider we can control the radius of the circles.

Count : Using this slider we can increase or decrease the number of wings.

Expand :This slider give us the opportunity to maximum Or minimize the gap between boundary edge and the geometry.

Decay :using this slider we can control the interference of the pattern.

Many researcher are using this technique to get an idea using magnetic field to generate some direction and rotate curves depending on distance or magnetic field.
